## What I learned üßë‚Äçüíª

I learned to create routes with React Navigation , I learned and applied the MVVM design pattern to my screens to make the application scalable, I learned to use Google firebase to create the application's backend. I learned to run tests on the frontend with jest and React Native Test Library. I learned to manage form state and do validations with yup.
